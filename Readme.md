About:
In India, the present scenario of the official document processing (i.e. â€“ Transfer request, Hierarchical Official letter etc) is majorly a pen and paper based system.
Which leads to numerous problems, such as Delay in the processing of documents due to transportation from one office to another and negligence of authorities, loss of important documents, corruption, storage problems, leakage of confidential data, preservation of old documents, the transport cost, etc.

The main focus of this project was to digitize the official document processing with the use of AADHAR and there by providing end to end securely encrypted platform through which the files can be transferred to the officials through the internet.
